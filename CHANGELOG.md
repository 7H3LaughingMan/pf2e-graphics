## [0.0.9] - Unreleased

### Added

  - Examples include preventing playing generic base animations on specific weapons (Arquebus > Firearm group.)
- `.wait` and `.delay` Sequencer options.
- Animations predicated upon on Performance Settings

### Changed
- `options.shape.value` to `options.shape.type`

### Fixed
- Users being spammed with errors telling they are attempting to animate something without a token present.
  - Especially egregious during system migrations, causing animations based on creating, updating, or removing effects and items to trigger.
  - The error is now quietly put into console, with the error being only "loud" in dev mode.
- Animation Triggers being added since the moment the user loads, before the system is even ready.
